**Skill Biased Reallocation** (JMP) [draft](https://hanksf.github.io/files/skill_biased_reallocation.pdf)

Abstract: Workers displaced by the reallocation of labour demand across industries suffer persistent earnings losses, in a large part due to higher unemployment risk.
This paper quantifies the aggregate unemployment implications of a reallocation of labour demand.
I develop a search and matching model with multiple industries and industry specific skill that is calibrated to the US economy.
In the model a reallocation shock leads to up to a 0.8 percentage points rise in unemployment.
The combination of industry specific skill and the substitutability between workers of different skill levels are key to this result.
A policy of subsidies for vacancy posting can reduce this rise but only when targeted by skill level.

**The Role of Demographics in Cross-Cohort Lifetime Income Differences** with [Laura Murphy](https://www.lauracharlottemurphy.com/) 

Abstract: We study how demographic changes in the US affect men’s lifetime incomes
through career spillovers. American men’s lifetime median incomes have followed a hump shaped
pattern: rising with each cohort entering the labour market from the late 1950s
until the 1970s, and subsequently falling. The start of decline coincides with the entry
of the baby boomers who represent a structural break in the size of incoming cohorts.
The availability of higher-compensated management tasks increases with the number of
lower ranked (younger) workers. So, a larger cohort of workers will increase (decrease)
the opportunities of their predecessors(successors), in contrast to the symmetric effect
predicted by traditional models. We utilize a simple model to show cross-cohort differences
in promotions to higher rank jobs can account for the shape of lifetime median incomes
observed in the data. We also show the promotion mechanism is consistent with several
other cross-cohort empirical facts.

**The Joint Dynamics of Labour and Capital** with [Matias Bayas-Erazo](https://matiasbayas-erazo.com/)

[draft](https://hanksf.github.io/files/labour_capital.pdf)

Abstract: Models of lumpy capital adjustment are too responsive to interest rates
relative to empirical evidence. We argue that allowing for small convex adjustment costs in
labour can help these models better match the data. Convex costs cause labour to increase
slowly in response to a shock thus smoothing out the impact on the marginal product of
capital. Due to both depreciation and uncertainty over future productivity, this delay in
the benefits of additional capital can have a large impact on the responsiveness of capital
investment.

**The Response to Shocks in (S,s) Models with Drift** with [Matias Bayas-Erazo](https://matiasbayas-erazo.com/)

Abstract: Using recent advances in the study of partial differential equations, we
provide an analytical characterisation of the impact of a shock in an (S,s) model with drift.
This result has applications to studying inaction in models with menu costs and investment
behaviour in models with fixed costs of investment.
