Welcome to my website. I am a 6th year Economics PhD student at Northwestern University. I am going on 2023-2024 academic job market.

I study the macroeconomics of labour markets.

My job market paper is

**Skill Biased Reallocation** [draft](https://hanksf.github.io/files/skill_biased_reallocation.pdf)

Abstract: Workers displaced by the reallocation of labour demand across industries are more likely to be unemployed but does this impact aggregate unemployment?
In this paper I argue that industry specific skill and the substitutability between workers of different skill levels are key determinants of the impact.
In a search and matching model with these features calibrated to the US economy, a reallocation shock leads to up to a 0.8 percentage points rise in unemployment.
Subsidies for vacancy posting can reduce this rise but only when targeted by skill level.
