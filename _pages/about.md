Welcome to my website. I am a 6th year Economics PhD student at Northwestern University. I am going on 2023-2024 academic job market.

I study the macroeconomics of labour markets.

My job market paper is

**Skill Biased Reallocation** [draft](https://hanksf.github.io/files/skill_biased_reallocation.pdf)

Abstract: Workers displaced by the reallocation of labour demand across industries suffer persistent earnings losses, in a large part due to higher unemployment risk.
This paper quantifies the aggregate unemployment implications of a reallocation of labour demand.
I develop a search and matching model with multiple industries and industry specific skill that is calibrated to the US economy.
In the model a reallocation shock leads to up to a 0.8 percentage points rise in unemployment.
The combination of industry specific skill and the substitutability between workers of different skill levels are key to this result.
A policy of subsidies for vacancy posting can reduce this rise but only when targeted by skill level.
